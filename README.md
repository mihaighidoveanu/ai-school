# Machine Learning Examples

Various projects and examples for Artificial Intelligence. 
Work is done according to the Master's degree of AI at University of Bucharest. 

Projects are ordered based on semesters, increasing difficulty in the above mentioned degree program. Titles marked with *\** considered optional for the purpose of AI learning.

1. [Machine Learning]()
2. [Natural Language Processing]()
3. [Bayesian Inference]()
4. [Distributed Programming\*]()

## Purpose

I will add here all the projects I will do while learning artificial intelligence. 
Help yourself by seeing some working examples of artificiall intelligence concepts such as :

+ Machine Learning
+ Probabilistic Programming
+ Deep Learning
+ Natural Language Processing

## Contributions
Feel free to add your own examples, or make the available ones better.

## Environment

Most projects are done in a jupyter environment, using Python 3.x .
